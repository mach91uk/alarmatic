Privacy policy

General

Alarmatic is developed by one main developer, with a few people helping from time to time, mostly with translations.

Privacy Policy ("Policy") describes how information obtained from users is collected, used and disclosed.

By using Alarmatic, you agree that your personal information will be handled as described in this Policy.

Information being collected

Alarmatic does not collect any personal identifiable information.

The `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permission is only used for selecting a custom alarm sound.

The `READ_CALENDAR` permission is used only when we are checking if you are on holiday, so we can skip selected alarms.

Changes to the Policy

If the Policy changes, the modification date below will be updated. The Policy may change from time to time, so please be sure to check back periodically.
